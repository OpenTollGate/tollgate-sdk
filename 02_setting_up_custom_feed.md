The issue you're experiencing with the ImageBuilder is related to the fact that it's trying to create symbolic links for packages from custom feeds, but the corresponding directory structures do not exist. This results in errors like `ln: failed to create symbolic link './package/feeds/custom/': No such file or directory`.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### 1. Create the Required Directory Structure

Ensure the necessary directories exist inside the ImageBuilder environment to hold these symbolic links. For the `custom` feed, specifically:

```bash
mkdir -p package/feeds/custom
```

If you have other feeds, you can create their corresponding directories as well:

```bash
mkdir -p package/feeds/telephony
mkdir -p package/feeds/packages
mkdir -p package/feeds/luci
mkdir -p package/feeds/routing
```

### 2. Update Feeds Again

After creating the directories, run the feed update and install commands again:

```bash
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
```

### 3. Check the Feeds Configuration

Ensure your `feeds.conf` file is correctly set up and points to valid repositories. It looks like your `feeds.conf` should be fine based on the previous messages:

```plaintext
src-git packages https://git.openwrt.org/feed/packages.git^063b2393cbc3e5aab9d2b40b2911cab1c3967c59
src-git luci https://git.openwrt.org/project/luci.git^b07cf9dcfc37e021e5619a41c847e63afbd5d34a
src-git routing https://git.openwrt.org/feed/routing.git^648753932d5a7deff7f2bdb33c000018a709ad84
src-git telephony https://git.openwrt.org/feed/telephony.git^86af194d03592121f5321474ec9918dd109d3057
src-git-full custom https://github.com/OpenTollGate/TollGateFeed.git;main
```

### 4. Manually Check Symbolic Links

Verify that the symbolic links for each package are correctly created in the `package/feeds/custom` directory. If they are not created, you may need to manually create them:

```bash
ln -s ../../../feeds/custom/gltollgate package/feeds/custom/gltollgate
ln -s ../../../feeds/custom/libsecp256k1 package/feeds/custom/libsecp256k1
ln -s ../../../feeds/custom/libwallycore package/feeds/custom/libwallycore
...
```

### 5. Ensure Packages Are Correctly Indexed

Make sure that the packages in your local feed directory are indexed correctly. Run the following command within your custom feed directory:

```bash
opkg-make-index . > Packages
gzip -k Packages
```

### 6. Modify Build Scripts If Necessary

Ensure that your build scripts account for the custom feed. For instance, your `build-firmware` script should reflect the usage of these feeds correctly.

```bash
# Example of invoking ImageBuilder
make image PROFILE="your_profile" PACKAGES="base-files libc libopenssl your_custom_package"
```

### Example Adjustments to Build Script

Hereâ€™s an example modification to include your custom feed and packages:

```bash
# Ensure the environment is correct
export FEEDS_CONF=feeds.conf
export PACKAGES="libc libopenssl your_custom_package ..."

# Check if custom feed directory and links exist
if [ ! -d package/feeds/custom ]; then
    mkdir -p package/feeds/custom
fi

# Link all custom packages
for pkg in gltollgate libsecp256k1 libwallycore ...; do
    if [ ! -L package/feeds/custom/$pkg ]; then
        ln -s ../../../feeds/custom/$pkg package/feeds/custom/
    fi
done

# Update and install feeds
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a

# Build image
make image PROFILE="your_profile" PACKAGES="$PACKAGES"
```

By ensuring that the directories and symbolic links for the custom feeds are correctly set up, you should be able to avoid the `ln: failed to create symbolic link` errors and properly build your OpenWRT image with the required packages.
