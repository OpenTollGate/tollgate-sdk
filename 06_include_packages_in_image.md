To ensure that the programs you compiled with the OpenWrt SDK are included in the `sysupgrade` binaries generated by the Image Builder, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Proper Package Structure

1. **Organize Your Source Code:**
   Place your Go program source files in a specific directory structure that aligns with OpenWrt's package convention. For example:
   ```
   └── package
       └── my-go-program
           ├── Makefile
           └── src
               └── main.go
   ```

2. **Write an OpenWrt Makefile:**
   Create a `Makefile` in the `my-go-program` directory. This `Makefile` should specify how to build and install your program according to OpenWrt's conventions. For Go programs, you may need to define custom compile and install commands. Here is an example[1]:
   ```makefile
   define Build/Compile
       $(GO) build -o $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/my-go-program main.go
   endef

   define Package/my-go-program/install
       $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/usr/bin
       $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/my-go-program $(1)/usr/bin/
   endef
   ```
   Make sure the `Makefile` also includes the necessary declarations like `PKG_NAME`, `PKG_VERSION`, `PKG_LICENSE`, and `PKG_MAINTAINER`.

   Here's the complete `Makefile`:
   ```makefile
   include $(TOPDIR)/rules.mk

   PKG_NAME:=my-go-program
   PKG_VERSION:=1.0
   PKG_LICENSE:=MIT
   PKG_MAINTAINER:=Your Name <your.name@example.com>

   include $(INCLUDE_DIR)/package.mk

   define Build/Compile
       $(GO) build -o $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/my-go-program main.go
   endef

   define Package/my-go-program/install
       $(INSTALL_DIR) $(1)/usr/bin
       $(INSTALL_BIN) $(PKG_BUILD_DIR)/my-go-program $(1)/usr/bin/
   endef

   define Package/my-go-program
       SECTION:=utils
       CATEGORY:=Utilities
       TITLE:=My Go Program
   endef

   $(eval $(call BuildPackage,my-go-program))
   ```

### 2. Add Your Package to the Image Builder

1. **Copy Your Package Directory:**
   Move the `my-go-program` directory into the `/path/to/OpenWrt-SDK/package/` directory of your Image Builder setup.

2. **Configure the Image Builder:**
   Modify the `PACKAGES` variable in your `Makefile` or when running the `make image` command to include your package[4]. For example:
   ```bash
   make image PROFILE="your-profile" PACKAGES="my-go-program"
   ```

By following these steps, your compiled Go program will be included in the `sysupgrade` binary generated by the Image Builder.
